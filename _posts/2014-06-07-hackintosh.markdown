For the past few years, I have been installing numbers of Mac OS x operating software to my machine. Yes, I did break their EULA. However, I believe this is not illegal since you are not selling hackintosh. 

Below is the history, starting when I started with Mac OS x Tiger to now (Mac OS x Yosemite). 

Mac OS x Yosemite (2014):



Mac OS x Mavericks (2013):

Mac OS x Mountain Lion (2012):

Mac OS x Lion (2011):

Mac OS x Snow Leopard(2010):

Mac OS x Tiger(2009):


I remember when I was researching, "How to install Mac on pc" back in 2009, thinking it is possible to install Mac on non-apple based computer. I would spend days, trying to get the mac os to work on my pc. I read number of tutorials, "what kext am I suppose to install?", "what bootloader should I use?", etc. It was such a pain in my butt and still exist today.

I wanted to thanks to InsanelyMac, without you guys, I would have probably give up, and saying it's not worth it.

Here is my Spec (OS: 10.7 - 10.10):
Intel i7 Processor, 3rd Gen |
AMD Radeon 7770 2GB |
8GB RAM |
1TB and 250GB HDD

You would probably be asking me some quesitons. For example, "Why Mac?", "Do you know Mac sucks, right?", or "Do you know hackintosh is really buggy?", blah and blah.

The reason, I want Mac is that so I can develop an iOS app. I first started to learn Objective-C in Summer Camp 2012 (DUCA aka Drexel University of Computing Academy). 

"In the summer of 2012, I was accepted to Drexel University's Computing Academy for a 5 week program. The primary goal of this program was to introduce high school students to computer science and give students the experience of college life while living in the dorm. The admission process was very competitive and requires you to stay in the dorm for 5 weeks to experience college life. Only 50 students were accepted from 14 states to this program.

At Drexel's Computing Academy showed me that this strength can help me succeed in even very rigorous and competitive environments. In this program, all students were divided into 15 teams and were asked to come with an idea for a final project. My team and I had to come up with one idea for a project to develop a video game for iPhone. I was assigned the role of lead programmer. We brainstormed a number of ideas and presented the final idea to professor for advice. The idea was to develop a game for the iPhone called "Doodle Tunes." The player has to drag a spaceship and collect stars. If they are hit by an asteroid, the game is over and they try again. This game is simple and fun, and has great music and design. My professor agreed on the concept and gave us permission to develop the requirements for the game. I worked with my team during the daytime in class, as well as in the evening to meet the deadline to submit the project. At the end of the program, every team presented their project in front of the committee and my project came in second out of 15 teams. We were very happy with the results and I have posted this game on the Apple app store with financial help from my dad. 

During the five weeks program, I gained critical skills that are required in college, such as critical thinking to solve problems, leadership skills to lead a team, and most importantly, the confidence to achieve my goals. Last but not least, I had an opportunity to make new friends and learn from them.

"Do you know hackintosh is not really stable, right?"

It is true in some cases. However, if you know what you are doing and installing the right kexts and modifying the DSDT, then your hackintosh is stable like mine! I have not experience the crash yet, well few times. I can able to run hackintosh fine, the boot took me close to 45 seconds in Yosemite and 1 minute in Mavericks. Isn't that amazing? Hahaha.

I am out. Thank you for reading my post! Peace out.
