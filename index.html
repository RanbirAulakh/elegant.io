    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>
        Hi, our names are Joseph Bartelmo and Ranbir Aulakh. We have been programming for many years and have known each other for about 3 years as of 2014. The first website we met on (which is now extinct) was called <em>undergroundcoding.com</em>. Joe was a manager on this site, and we eventually met each other. At this time Ranbir was working on a site called <em>zChrome.com</em> which was an amateur modding website for NBA based games. We morphed the site into <em>Xbox360Content.com</em>, which was a bustling community in its time due to program we developed, <em>Revelation</em>. As the time goes on, we both eventually gave up due to inactivity on the site, and we decided to form this blog since we are always posting things on the internet.
